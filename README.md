# GraphQL Java Server with PostgreSQL



This is the source code for the "Getting started with GraphQL Java and Spring Boot" which is available here: https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot/


This demo provides an overview of a GraphQL Java server built using the graphql-java library and connected to the Chinook database on PostgreSQL.

Features:

* Exposes a GraphQL API for accessing Chinook music store data.
* Demonstrates initial setup with static data (from the Spring Boot tutorial) and then integration with PostgreSQL.
* Addresses N+1 query problem in GraphQL Java.

Technology Stack:

Java 21
Spring Boot
graphql-java
graphql-servlet
PostgreSQL
chinook-database (optional)


Getting Started:

* Clone the repository.
* Install Prerequisites:
* Ensure Java 21 is installed and available in your PATH.
* Install Gradle.
* Install and configure PostgreSQL.
* Download the chinook database and place it in the src/main/resources directory (optional).

Build and Run:

Run mvn clean package or gradle clean build.
Run the application with java -jar target/graphql-java-postgres-chinook.jar.
Access the GraphQL API:
Use a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Altair.
The server endpoint is available at http://localhost:8080/graphql.
Data:

Initially, the server uses static data from the tutorial.
To connect to PostgreSQL and access Chinook data:
Update the application.properties file with your PostgreSQL connection details.
Uncomment the @EnableJpaRepositories annotation in Application.java.
Ensure you have the chinook-database file in the correct location.

N+1 Query Problem:

The tutorial example demonstrates potential N+1 queries.
Implement proper data fetching logic in resolvers to avoid N+1 queries.
Refer to GraphQL Java documentation and best practices for efficient data retrieval.
